===========

Libiqxmlrpc is an object-oriented library, which represents simple XML-RPC 
solution both for client and server sides.

Please, look into doc/index.html for further reading. This file explains only
some steps of building and testing of the library.


Build library
-------------

$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make

## Build tests
$ make check

## Install
$ make install

Directories libiqnet and libiqxmlrpc contain project sources/headers. Directory
tests contains tests/examples for libiqxmlrpc library. Directory tests.libiqnet 
contains tests for libiqnet subproject.


Build documentation
-------------------

You may also want to build documentation. In this case do the following:

$ cd doc
$ doxygen libiqnet.doxygen
$ doxygen libiqxmlrpc.doxygen

When you will done it, two directories with HTML docs must appear here:
  libiqnet.html/ 
  libiqxmlrpc.html/
