The primary goal for this samples is to check if user may successfully build
code that uses library, installed into default location.

So first install library using "sudo make install" command and then you would
be able to complile samples using following commands:

g++ `pkg-config --libs --cflags libiqxmlrpc` server.cc -o server
g++ `pkg-config --libs --cflags libiqxmlrpc` client.cc -o client
